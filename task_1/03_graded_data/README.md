## 03 Graded Data

We noticed that there were weekly scores for classroom performance, 
homework, and practice in the grade table, 
and, in the sixth week, there was a test, 
again with test scores. 
Students' weekly grades and week 6 test scores likewise reflect their learning, 
so we added these data to the dataset.

- `data.csv`: Generated data files that have been desensitized. The first 6 weeks of lectures and homework + practical scoring data were added.
- `data.ipynb`: Get the data.
- `train.ipynb`: Train the classifier.

Result:

- Accuracy: `94.60%`
- Recall rate: `34.75%`

Compared to the previous section, 
the performance has improved, 
but is still worse than the 16-week data. 
The recall rate is too low.
