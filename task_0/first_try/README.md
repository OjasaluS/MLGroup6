## First try

This is a simple first attempt based on data, aiming to rule out bad options/data choices.

This test is only based on the frequency of users accessing various components of Moodle for training. Since it is only a first attempt, some details are not restricted. Finally, SVM is used for two classifications. It can be seen that the model tends to classify users into categories above 60 points, and the recall rate of users below 60 points is very low. This performance can be improved by adjusting the penalty parameters, but it may also mean that the frequency of users accessing the components is not the main influencing factor.
